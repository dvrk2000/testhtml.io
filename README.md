### Introduction

**Problem Situation:**  
Currently in the United States, approximately 27.4 million people are without healthcare insurance [1]. The U.S. healthcare system has failed to insure millions of people, many of which cannot afford to pay for healthcare out-of-pocket. There have already been policies implemented in order to increase healthcare coverage across the board, which have partially relieved the gap in those who have healthcare and those who don’t [1]. However, there are ethical issues when considering the groups of people that struggle to get health insurance in the U.S.

**What is the problem?**  
There are about 27.4 million people that do not have health insurance. Out of these people, many of them are a part of groups that have been perpetually discriminated against within the U.S. as an institution. This forces continued inequality across different populations in the U.S., and healthcare should be seen as a deserved right to all. When we don’t think everyone should have a form of healthcare, then we create not just gaps in having healthcare, but also gaps in the overall health of groups of people.

**Why does it matter?**  
The proportion of people without insurance in the U.S. is about 8%. While this is a small percentage of people, there is an ethical duty in ensuring equity among groups of people. This is especially concerning because people without health insurance may avoid taking care of themselves or their family because they can’t pay for the cost of healthcare. Making sure people are healthy is a priority for many countries that are similar to the U.S., yet we fall short when it comes to peoples’ health and there are no excuses for falling behind [4].

**How will it be addressed?**  
We will address this problem by making the millions of people without healthcare more visible. The number 27.4 million is small when compared to the entire U.S. population of about 330 million people [5]. We alone cannot solve all of the problems that occur within the U.S. healthcare system, but if we are able to put focus on how many individuals don’t have the means to ensure their health, then we can start a conversation on how to start getting people insurance.

### Research Questions
How effective have current policies been in mitigating the gap in those with insurance and those without?

How can statistics in health insurance show the inequalities that occur throughout the U.S.?

### Possible data sets

Name: Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population: 2017

Short description: The health coverage topic is based on American Community Survey (ACS), there are six types of insurance coverage including employer, non-group, medicaid, medicare, other public and uninsured which are grouped by States in 2017. The result showing the percentage of each type in different State and summarise the total of each State to present the
percentage of United States.

Number of observations: 56

Number of attributes: 6

Name: Health Insurance Coverage by Age: 2017 and 2018

Short description: The health insurance converge is based on American Community Survey(ACS), there are two main health insurance (private and public) and uninsured which are grouped by 8 different age groups in 2017 and 2018. The result showing the percentage of each year in different group and the percentage change from 2017 to 2018.

Number of observations: 8

Number of attributes: 22

### Information Visualizations
There are approximately 27.4 million people are without healthcare insurance and from this visualization, we can easily identify the percentage without health insurance by the lightness of the states.  We observe a trend that the southern areas like Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas have a large population who are not covered. Especially in Texas, the general uncover rate is 8% in the US but Texas has more than 12% uncovered population. We want to find out what are the reasons and how to solve this.  


This image presents how health insurance programs change over from 1997 to 2017 with difference policies implemented. For curves 1, 3, 5, they are the policies that are in processing steps. For curves 2 and 4, they represent changes to survey instruments like follow-up verification questions. It is obvious that with different policies adaptation, the overall uninsurance rate is decreasing.  

### Team Coordination
Our team will be meeting every week on Thursdays from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Our goal is to create a meaningful project that will hopefully spur a conversation on the healthcare disparities that people in the U.S. currently face. We will all be contributing equally to the various tasks needed to complete this project. We will all help each other in creating the code to visualize our data sets and with explaining why this information matters. We will communicate through a group message and provide feedback through this text chain and in person at our meetings. We will frequently communicate to ensure that everyone understands their duties.
